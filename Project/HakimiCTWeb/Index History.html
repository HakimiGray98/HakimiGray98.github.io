  <h1>The Evolution of Computer Screen</h1>

<p class="hp">From year to year, there are always a development process that happened toward our technologies, including our screen monitor. Here are the timeline regarding the changes that happened toward the monitor's screen. 
</p>

    <ul class="lala">
<li>1964</li>

<p>The Uniscope 300 machine had a built-in CRT (cathode ray tube) display. While not a true computer monitor, it was a precursor to CRT monitor technology.

<li>1973</li>

<p>The Xerox Alto computer, which was released on March 1st 1973, included the first computer monitor. The monitor used CRT technology and had a monochrome display.​</p>

<li>1977</li>

<p>LED display technology was developed by James P. Mitchell in 1977. Unfortunately, LED (light-emitting diode) monitors were not readily available for purchase on the consumer market until about 30 years later. One of the first LCD (liquid-crystal display) monitors for desktop computers was the Eizo L66, manufactured and released by Eizo Nanao Technologies in the mid-1990s.​</p>

<li>1987</li>

<p>The first VGA (video graphics array) monitor, <strong>the IBM 8513</strong>, was released by IBM (International Business Machines) in 1987. In 1989, The SVGA (super video graphics array) standard for computer displays was officially defined by VESA. By the late 1980s, color CRT monitors were capable of a 1024 x 768 resolution display.​</p>

<li>1997</li>

<p>Apple, IBM, and Viewsonic began developing color LCD monitors that offer comparable or better quality and resolution compared to CRT monitors. In 1998, The Apple Studio Display was one of the earliest affordable, color LCD monitors for desktop computers, manufactured by Apple.​</p>

<li>2003​</li>

<p>LCD monitors outsold CRT monitors for the first time in 2003. By 2007, LCD monitors became the most prominent type of computer monitor. Jeff Han introduced the first interface-free, touch-based computer monitor at TED in 2006.</p>

<p>In 2009, NEC was one of the first companies to manufacture LED monitors, the MultiSync EA222WMe ,for desktop computers.</p>

<li>2010​</li>

<p>AMD and Intel, with a handful of computer monitor manufacturers, announced they were phasing out support for VGA starting in December 2010.​</p>

<li>2017​</li>

<p>Touch screen LCD monitors started to become cheaper, more affordable for the average consumer in 2017. Prices for 20 to 22-inch touch screen monitors dropped below $500.​</p>

    <h2>Comparison Between CRT, LED and LCD monitors</h2>

<p bgcolor=grey>Aside from the history of screen, there also comparison between the CRT, LED and LCD monitors. These comparisons are important as they also highlighting the pro and cons between these three screens. Here are the table that simplifies the comparisons between CRT, LED and LCD screen. </p>
