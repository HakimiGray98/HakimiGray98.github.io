      <div>
        Hey there what's up? <br> <br>
        In this segment of the page we will be discussing the key differences between <strong>prefered display screens among
           <em>content creators</em> and <em>gamers</em></strong>! 
        <h3><U>To get started let's <em>familiarize</em> on who are:</U></h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Content creators</li>
        <p>A <b>content creator</b> is someone who creates entertaining or educational material to be expressed through any medium or channel.</p>
        <img src="Content creator gif.gif" height="360" width="720">
        <li>Gamers</li>
        <p>A gamer is a proactive hobbyist who plays interactive games for long periods of time.</p>

          <header>
            <h2>Display preferences for content creators</h2>
          </header>
          <P>To answer this question we would have to plan our journey which starts with:
            <ol>
              <li>Planning an interview with a content creator</li>
              <li>Preparing questions that helps to answer the main question. 
                For example, what is the screen size, screen resolution and display technology they'd use</li>
                <li>Finding a content creator who is well versed in display knowledge to provide sufficient information</li>
                <li>Finding a venue and setting a time to conduct the interview</li>
                <li>Conducting the interview itself!!!!</li>
            </ol>
            Now I will display my findings through a good friend who happens to be a content creator.
          </P>
